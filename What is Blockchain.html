							<p>Is a series of blocks with the main fuction of store data. Each block is divided in two parts, the metadata and the transactions, the metadata contains informations about the time and cryptographic signature to ensure the value. Transactions are about price, asset, and ownership. It is important to say that the blocks that are already in the chain can't be changed. </p>

							<p>Whats makes blockchain so interesting is the fact of not running in a single computer, but in a whole network. The network security is in the mining process with the algorithm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work"> Proof of work (POW)</a> his complexity ensures the security of the chain. Every data in the blockchain can be seen. </p>

								<p>It is common for people to confuse the blockchain with the crypto cryptocurrency. Blockchain is just a technology and it has different purposes, the most known purpose is in cryptocurrency.</p>

							<p>Bitcoin was the first the blockchain and it was revolutionary, but it was quite limited, so then it came Ethereum. it uses blocks, transactions, minors, adresses and it is associated with the cryptocurrency ether. In this technology is the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/">Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)</a> wich is able to run smart contracts, the code of the contract runs on the blockchain and it is very hard to be hacked.</p>

							<p>And there is also the cryptographic hash, those are used to identify a piece of data uniquely that looks like a string of characters.</p>

							<p>In Ethereum adresses are created with private keys like passwords, it consists in a private key and a public key, it is 128 characters long and it uses the cryptographic hash. The public key it can be given to anyone to recieve a transaction.</p>

							<p>To be part of this transactions you need a wallet, the most populars are metamask and nano ledger, metamask is virtual and nano ledger is hardware and you can have it in a flash drive. They have the purpose of generating multiple public adresses to ensure the privacy.</p>

							<p>There is three type of transactions, for send ether, for execute a smart contract, and for create a new smart contract.</p>

							<p>The fields of a transaction must have the from field to sign the transaction, the to for the recipient, the gas, that is paid to include the transaction in the blockchain, the value to specify how much ether are you goin to send if it is the case, and finaly to the declare the function that you want to execute.</p>

							<h2>Ethereum Smart Contracts</h2>
							<p>Smart contracts are the angular stone of ethereum, they are programs that can run in the blockchain, once they are uploaded they can't be manipulated and is almost impossible to hacked them, they are used for transfer Ethereum. They are very expensive and they have very limited capacities. To be able to program Smart Contracts you need two things, first the knowledge of a programming language like<a href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.14/">Solidity</a> secondly you need to compile it in the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/">Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)</a>. After that all you need to do is to create the smart contract in the blockchain for the transactions.</p>
							<p>The sender of a transactions needs to pay the "gas". This fee goes to the minor who mined the block that is being used. You can choose the gas price, and depending on how high is it the transaction will be faster.</p>

							<h2>Pointing has no control about the blind texts</h2>
							<p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large <a href="#">language</a> ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.</p>
							<p>She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way.</p>
